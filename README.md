# Shopping cart using a file as a database:

Created a shop cart app using file system as a database which uses crud functionalities.

## Working

A new product can be added and it will be displayed on the home page and at the same time the field details will be stored in the file system database. Within the app once once the add prodcut button is clicked the page will be redirected to the home page where the final product will be displayed.
